(bright upbeat music)

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.700 line:15% 
<v Narrator>A seafood market,</v>

3
00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.350
a virology lab, and a mine deep in the mountains.

4
00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:09.140 line:15% 
Key events at these places in China could be crucial

5
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:12.410 line:15% 
to understanding how a small cluster of coronavirus cases

6
00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.900 line:15% 
ended up sweeping the world.

7
00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.190 line:15% 
Because almost a year and a half

8
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.410 line:15% 
into this global health crisis, politicians and scientists

9
00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.490 line:15% 
are still debating how it all started.

10
00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.500 line:15% 
<v Betsy>If you're gonna look for the origin of a pandemic,</v>

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.210
you really should start right away when the clues are fresh.

12
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.910 line:15% 
Right now that's looking pretty difficult.

13
00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.360
<v Narrator>That's because access to Wuhan</v>

14
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.000
has been really limited.

15
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.280 line:15% 
<v ->Until you nail it down definitively,</v>

16
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.020 line:15% 
you've always got to keep an open mind

17
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.890 line:15% 
that it might be something else.

18
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:38.890 line:15% 
<v Narrator>The main hypothesis</v>

19
00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.170 line:15% 
is that the virus originated from bats.

20
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.020 line:15% 
Jumped to another animal, then to us.

21
00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.950 line:15% 
And the leap to humans

22
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.430
might've happened here at this market.

23
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.610
10 miles away is where some scientists believe

24
00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.523
that the virus may have accidentally leaked from a lab.

25
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.100
And both of these spots in Wuhan

26
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.920
have an increasingly important connection to one place

27
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.740
that's over 1000 miles away

28
00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.160
in the mountains of Yunnan province.

29
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.650 line:15% 
So we visit these key places

30
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.010 line:15% 
to break down what we know about the coronavirus

31
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.893 line:15% 
to understand how the global pandemic may have started.

32
00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.200 line:15% 
Stop number one, the Huanan Seafood Market,

33
00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.960 line:15% 
December 31st, 2019.

34
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.650
This is the day the WHO learned

35
00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.250
about a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan.

36
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.790
And increasingly, the focus was on the market.

37
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.820
The complex spans an area that's the size

38
00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.300
of nine football fields and has over 600 stalls.

39
00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.350 line:15% 
About 10 of those were selling wild animals

40
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.203 line:15% 
like bamboo rats, hedgehogs and hog badgers.

41
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.900 line:15% 
<v Betsy>These wildlife are raised on farms,</v>

42
00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.730 line:15% 
sometimes in crowded conditions

43
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.780 line:15% 
where it's easy for animals to spread viruses back

44
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.050 line:15% 
and forth between each other

45
00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:47.020
and the viruses start to mix and match and can change.

46
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.853
<v Narrator>Some wildlife</v>

47
00:01:47.853 --> 00:01:49.990
that are receptive to coronavirus infections

48
00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.550
are consumed in China,

49
00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.170
either for food or used in traditional medicine.

50
00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.230
<v Betsy>These animals are shipped to urban markets</v>

51
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.900
where they are sold sometimes live and butchered onsite.

52
00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.300
And all this contact with live possibly infected animals

53
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.210
or the infected fresh meat

54
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.170
has become a major concern in recent years.

55
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.250
<v Narrator>And in Wuhan, many of the first cases</v>

56
00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.360
were either vendors who worked at the market,

57
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.993 line:15% 
or people who had shopped there.

58
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.010
By January 1st, Chinese authorities shut the place down.

59
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:23.430 line:15% 
<v Betsy>Well, originally Chinese authorities did feel</v>

60
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.100
that it possibly came from the Huanan Market

61
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.763
and from wild meat of some sort.

62
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:31.340 line:15% 
<v Narrator>About three weeks later,</v>

63
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.560
scientists in Wuhan and Beijing published

64
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.350
a pivotal paper in the medical journal, The Lancet.

65
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.420
This chart shows how some of the early cases

66
00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.180
were people who hadn't been at the market.

67
00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.430 line:15% 
More than a year later, there was new data

68
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.800 line:15% 
to piece together a clearer picture,

69
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:46.970 line:15% 
that's because China allowed

70
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.820 line:15% 
a group of international scientists to come to Wuhan

71
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.690 line:15% 
for several weeks to visit the market and hospitals.

72
00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.200
<v Betsy>A team from the WHO that visited China</v>

73
00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.090
also learned going through the data

74
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.260
that by mid to late December,

75
00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.970
the viruses that were infecting people

76
00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.530
were genetically different enough

77
00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.040
that they knew it wasn't all coming from the same place.

78
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.410
<v Narrator>The WHO said the presence</v>

79
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.250
of early cases not linked to the market could suggest

80
00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:15.800
that it was not the original source of the outbreak.

81
00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.080
And increasingly, one place a team visited

82
00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:20.430 line:15% 
is at the center of another hypothesis,

83
00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.730 line:15% 
the Wuhan Institute of Virology.

84
00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.950 line:15% 
<v ->This is a world-class Institute</v>

85
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:27.260 line:15% 
with high security laboratories

86
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.720
and does a lot of work with scientists outside of China,

87
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.670
very vibrant collaboration before the pandemic.

88
00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.240
They would travel to caves where bats are known to roost

89
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.170
and take samples, and then study them in their lab.

90
00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:43.310
<v Narrator>These bat coronaviruses and pathogens</v>

91
00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.540
are cataloged in databases.

92
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.070
The researchers used this library of information

93
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.500
to compare it to blood samples

94
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.230
and oral swabs from patients in Wuhan.

95
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.320
And about a month after the market was closed,

96
00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.780
these researchers discovered that COVID-19

97
00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.880
had a 96.2% genetic match with the bat coronavirus

98
00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.603
that the institute had found back in 2013.

99
00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.530
Scientists around the world consider this

100
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:09.400
a breakthrough in the search for COVID-19 source,

101
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.840
because it strongly indicated

102
00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.700
that it could have originated in bats.

103
00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.600
<v ->This laboratory studies bat coronaviruses right in Wuhan,</v>

104
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.550
was an obvious question, could it have escaped?

105
00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.170
And even the Institute's own researchers asked that question

106
00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:25.210
and went and did their own research.

107
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.190 line:15% 
<v Narrator>As questions swirled</v>

108
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.760 line:15% 
around a possible accident at the institute,

109
00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:30.710 line:15% 
it's top bat coronavirus expert said

110
00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.800 line:15% 
the virus didn't leak from her labs,

111
00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:35.980 line:15% 
and none of its staff have tested positive for COVID-19.

112
00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.120
<v ->These are not the first times</v>

113
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.240
that we've had a world exposed to virus

114
00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.730
as a result of failures in a Chinese lab.

115
00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:46.300
<v ->Last year, what started out as a basic scientific question</v>

116
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.960
got politicized with a lot of finger pointing at China

117
00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.743
yet there was no evidence presented.

118
00:04:51.743 --> 00:04:54.073
(journalists chattering)

119
00:04:54.073 --> 00:04:55.570
<v Man>Anything sir.</v>

120
00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:57.640 line:15% 
<v Narrator>And there was also limited access to data</v>

121
00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.330 line:15% 
during the WHO-led team's trip to Wuhan.

122
00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:02.700 line:15% 
One of the stops was the virology institute.

123
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.830 line:15% 
<v ->They asked questions and they had a tour,</v>

124
00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:06.970 line:15% 
but they didn't get any firsthand look

125
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.390 line:15% 
at databases, medical records, any sort of raw data

126
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:12.730
which would have shed light

127
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:16.560 line:15% 
on whether the virus could have escaped or not.

128
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:17.530
<v Narrator>Almost a week later,</v>

129
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:20.480
scientists summed up their findings at a press conference.

130
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.390
They said the spillover from an intermediate host to humans

131
00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.220
was likely to very likely,

132
00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.330
and as for questions surrounding the lab.

133
00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:28.430 line:15% 
<v ->The findings suggest</v>

134
00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.590 line:15% 
that the laboratory incident hypothesis

135
00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.040 line:15% 
is extremely unlikely.

136
00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:39.030 line:15% 
<v Narrator>But later, the WHO chief said</v>

137
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.140
the team didn't sufficiently examine the lab hypothesis,

138
00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:43.973
and called for a fuller probe.

139
00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.700
Three months later after that press conference,

140
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.210
a group of leading virologists and epidemiologists

141
00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.170
wrote a letter saying there were no findings

142
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:52.300
in clear support of either

143
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:55.170
a natural spillover or a lab accident.

144
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:57.720
<v ->This group of people is not saying</v>

145
00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.450
that they believe it came from a lab.

146
00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:01.670
What they're saying

147
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:04.490
is that there's not enough evidence to rule it out.

148
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:07.310
Scientists investigate hypotheses

149
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:09.050
and they rule them out one by one.

150
00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.690
And they just said that process hasn't been able to happen

151
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:12.843 line:15% 
and it needs to happen.

152
00:06:12.843 --> 00:06:15.950 line:15% 
(speaking in foreign language)

153
00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.730 line:15% 
<v Narrator>China says it's cooperated fully</v>

154
00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:20.340
with the effort to search for COVID-19's source

155
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.173
and has urged the WHO

156
00:06:21.173 --> 00:06:24.483
to investigate early cases in other countries.

157
00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:26.840
(bright music)

158
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:28.770
And one place that could provide some new evidence

159
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.760 line:15% 
for both hypotheses, Yunnan.

160
00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:33.750 line:15% 
It's China's Southwestern most province

161
00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:36.260 line:15% 
and home to many coronavirus-carrying bats.

162
00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:38.330 line:15% 
And could set the stage for where the investigation

163
00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.800 line:15% 
into the origin of the virus could go next.

164
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.640 line:15% 
<v ->It's clearly an area where coronaviruses are circulating,</v>

165
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.160
including coronaviruses that are very closely related

166
00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.940 line:15% 
to SARS, the epidemic in 2003.

167
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.773 line:15% 
<v Narrator>Researchers</v>

168
00:06:53.773 --> 00:06:56.060 line:15% 
from the Wuhan Institute of Virology went to Yunnan

169
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.330
to study large bat populations inside caves.

170
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:02.510
In these crowded spaces, viral strains can mix together,

171
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.580 line:15% 
and become the building blocks of coronavirus

172
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.400 line:15% 
that then jump to humans.

173
00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.233 line:15% 
<v Betsy>And at the same time,</v>

174
00:07:07.233 --> 00:07:09.330 line:15% 
there are wildlife farms there

175
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.910 line:15% 
that supply animals to Wuhan.

176
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.230 line:15% 
<v Narrator>Scientists say, this could explain how a virus</v>

177
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.770 line:15% 
from a bat cave leapt to an intermediate host

178
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.370 line:15% 
then made its way to the market.

179
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.880 line:15% 
There was also a mine in Yunnan where scientists

180
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:25.230
from the institute spent some time from 2012 onwards.

181
00:07:25.230 --> 00:07:27.700 line:15% 
It's where six miners who'd been clearing bat droppings

182
00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:31.040 line:15% 
had gotten sick, and developed an unexplained pneumonia.

183
00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:32.273 line:15% 
Three of them died.

184
00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:37.010
So in 2013, scientists from the Institute went to the cave

185
00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:39.000 line:15% 
to collect samples from bats.

186
00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.160 line:15% 
A virus from one of these samples turned out

187
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:43.790
to be that 96.2% genetic match

188
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:46.910
that was discovered by the institute, inhaled as a big break

189
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:48.850
during the early days of the pandemic.

190
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.040
It took months for the institute

191
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:52.030
to reveal that the bat coronavirus samples

192
00:07:52.030 --> 00:07:54.643
were from the mine, and that there were sick miners.

193
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:57.590
<v ->The failure to describe it more</v>

194
00:07:57.590 --> 00:07:59.630
became kind of a touchpoint

195
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.680
for people who wanted more information

196
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.600
from the laboratory about the viruses they do have,

197
00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.750 line:15% 
and what work they've been doing with them.

198
00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.000 line:15% 
<v Narrator>Then, there was another allegation</v>

199
00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.760
about the institute that surfaced more than a year later.

200
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.310 line:15% 
<v ->What US intelligence officials learned</v>

201
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:21.100 line:15% 
is that there were three researchers

202
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:23.670 line:15% 
who became ill enough to seek hospital care.

203
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:25.640
They had symptoms that were like COVID,

204
00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:29.390
but the symptoms like COVID are also like flu symptoms.

205
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:32.840 line:15% 
And flu was definitely circulating in Wuhan at that time.

206
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.710 line:15% 
<v Narrator>Four days after the intelligence report</v>

207
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:37.900
about the sick lab workers, the Biden administration ordered

208
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.260
a US intelligence inquiry into the two scenarios.

209
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:43.314
China said the report was untrue.

210
00:08:43.314 --> 00:08:47.231 line:15% 
(speaking in foreign language)

211
00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.830 line:15% 
<v ->Some people don't believe China</v>

212
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.050
and say this has to be a coverup.

213
00:08:52.050 --> 00:08:55.330
Others say we just need to verify,

214
00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.750
though that's what we do in science.

215
00:08:56.750 --> 00:09:00.680
We verify, we look at the data and reach our own conclusion.

216
00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:04.710
It really does boil down to a question of transparency.

217
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:06.250 line:15% 
<v Narrator>So for any progress to be made</v>

218
00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.940 line:15% 
in the origins of the virus,

219
00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:10.140 line:15% 
it'll ultimately require more data,

220
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:13.492
and fuller access to where it was first detected in China.

221
00:09:13.492 --> 00:09:16.075 line:15%
